Read / write access to some common neuroimaging file formats

This package provides read +/- write access to some common medical and
neuroimaging file formats, including: ANALYZE_ (plain, SPM99, SPM2 and later),
GIFTI_, NIfTI1_, NIfTI2_, MINC1_, MINC2_, MGH_ and ECAT_ as well as Philips
PAR/REC.  We can read and write Freesurfer_ geometry, and read Freesurfer
morphometry and annotation files.  There is some very limited support for
DICOM_.  NiBabel is the successor of PyNIfTI_.

.. _MINC1:

.. _MINC2:
    https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC/Reference/MINC2.0_File_Format_Reference
.. _PyNIfTI: http://niftilib.sourceforge.net/pynifti/
.. _GIFTI: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti
.. _MGH: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/MghFormat
.. _ECAT: http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net/Docs/Ecat
.. _Freesurfer: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu
.. _DICOM: http://medical.nema.org/

The various image format classes give full or selective access to header (meta)
information and access to the image data is made available via NumPy arrays.
